                Days - Fake Or Real?

            <p><span class="secondary-text-bold">Kelly Clarkson claims she never used Ozempic or had any weight loss
                    surgery — despite what people assumed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="intro-paragraph">She says she discovered a simple <span class="primary-text-highlight">Gelatin
                    trick</span> at a private clinic in Hollywood…
                And she confirms that <span class="secondary-text-bold">Adele, Rebel Wilson,</span> and other
                celebrities
                are using the exact same method — which explains how they slim down so fast.

            <p class="intro-paragraph secondary-text-bold">Read until the end to understand why this works.</p>

            <p class="secondary-text-bold">If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve noticed how fast some celebrities
                are shedding weight and
                keeping flawless figures.
            </p>
            <p>Today, you’ll uncover a simple <span class="secondary-text-bold">homemade recipe</span> that many are now
                calling the <span class="primary-text-highlight">“Gelatin Trick.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="secondary-text-bold">This Hollywood-favorite method is said to help you lose up to 10 pounds
                    per week — naturally.</span>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: xx-large; color: #CC0000; font-weight: 900;">But is it true?
            </p>
            <p>At ABC News Program - Good Morning America, we are committed to the truth. That’s why we invited Linsey
                Davis to sit down with the renowned Doctor Jennifer Ashton for a quick and honest interview.
            </p>

            <p><span class="secondary-text-bold">Linsey Davis:</span> “Good evening, Doctor. Thanks for being here. <br>
                This week, we’ve been flooded with messages from viewers who say they’ve seen posts claiming you and
                several of your celebrity clients lost weight using something called the “Gelatin Trick.”<br>
                Is there any truth to that, or is it just another internet myth?

            </p>
            <img src="images/image4.png" class="main-article-image">
            <p><span class="secondary-text-bold">Jennifer Ashton:</span> First of all, thank you for inviting me. I’m
                really grateful for the chance to clear this up, because it’s incredibly important. <br>
                Those stories going viral? They’re not just random rumors. I have been using this Gelatin
                routine myself — and many of my high-profile clients have used it as part of their own weight-loss
                journeys. <br>
                A lot of the people I work with — actors, musicians, TV personalities — don’t have time for two-hour
                workouts or complicated diets. They’re exhausted, overbooked, and honestly fed up with unrealistic
                expectations.
                This simple little method fit into their crazy schedules… and it helped them finally start seeing the
                scale move again.
            </p>
            <img src="images/image3.png" alt="Linsey Davis speaking" class="main-article-image">
            <p><span class="secondary-text-bold">Linsey Davis:</span> And we can see the proof. Your own transformation
                is incredible — dropping 52 pounds is no small thing, especially with your schedule. <br>
                We’re also hearing that several of your celebrity clients have had real success with this same Gelatin
                trick, which explains why the recipe is exploding on social media. It’s easy, it’s fast… and people say
                it actually works. <br>
                Because of all the buzz, we asked our team to prepare a full report on how this recipe works and whether
                the claims hold up. <br>
                And you went even further — you recently filmed an in-depth segment walking step-by-step through how
                this Gelatin routine fits into a normal day, and how you personally used it during your own
                weight-loss journey.
